# Personal Portfolio Website

A minimal, clean portfolio website designed to impress recruiters and showcase your skills professionally.

## Pages & Sections

### 1. Home / Hero Section
- Your name, title (e.g. "Full-Stack Developer"), and a short tagline
- Call-to-action buttons: "View Projects" and "Download Resume"
- Clean, professional layout with ample whitespace

### 2. About Section
- A brief bio paragraph about you
- Tech stack / skills displayed as clean badges or icons
- Profile photo placeholder

### 3. Projects Section
- A curated grid of your best projects (manually configured)
- Each project card shows: title, description, tech used, and links to GitHub repo / live demo
- Clean hover effects for interactivity

### 4. Resume Page
- A dedicated page displaying your resume content inline (Experience, Education, Skills)
- Timeline-style layout for work experience and education
- Option to download your resume as a PDF

### 5. Contact Section
- Contact form (name, email, message)
- Links to your GitHub, LinkedIn, and email
- Simple footer with social links

## Design
- Minimal and clean aesthetic with professional typography
- Light theme with subtle accent color
- Smooth scroll navigation between sections
- Fully responsive (mobile-friendly for recruiters on the go)

## Technical Notes
- All content will be easily editable in simple data files — you just update your info in one place
- No backend needed — static content with a contact form using a mailto link or toast notification
- GitHub links will be static (you curate which projects to show)
